			<h1>Story in my Eyes</h1>
			<div id="pic">
					<img alt="story" class="home-story" src="story.jpg" />
					</div>
			<p>This initiative was created by 10 students who decided to join the fight against racism and discrimination. The project was sponsored by P2P and Facebook. It was established in 2017, when European Union was experiencing great influx of immigrants from the Middle East and often was failing to apply policies of multiculturalism which in return often provoked aggression towards migrants. Our initiative started working in small community in Klaipeda, Lithuania, which was accapting migrants from the Middle East. Our goal was to research people's attitudes towards migrants and organize events to alter false beliefs about migration. My job in this project was being a researcher and project manager of a small team that was responsible for the majority of functions of the organization. </p>	
			<h1>Initiative for Dialogue and Coflict Transformation</h1>	
			<div id="pic">

					</div>
			<p>Initiative for Dialogue and Coflict Transformation was established as a part of bigger NGO "The Center for Faith and Human Flourishing (CFHF)". The main goal of the initiative is to raise important daily questions to people and help them to answer them. It is common for people to show negative attitude to events through insults and violence. The initiative tries to educate people how to solve issues in a peaceful way and why it is needed to do so. One of the recent events organized by the initiative was teaching to people basis of media literacy, how to detect fake news, how to react to haters, and how to resolve online conflicts in non-aggressive manner. Due to the fact that this is a small initiative, there are currently only 5 employees there, so I was responsible for all kinds of tasks, like communication, organizing events, and managing the budget.</p>	
			<h1>Advocacy Campaign against Child Drinking in Ukraine</h1>	
			<div id="pic">

					</div>
		    <p>I organized this advocacy campaing to help Ukraine stop being in top-10 of most drinking countries of the world and fight for the future of new generations of the country. The advocacy involved communication with members of Ukrainian parliament and lobbying new regulations on alcohol sales.</p>	
			<h1>Cybersecurity Concerns and Threats in Lithuania</h1>	
			<div id="pic">
					<img alt="cyber" class="home-cyber" src="cyber.jpg" />
					</div>
			<p>This is the project that I have been working on most recently. The idea is that nowadays we face great number of threats online, like identity fraud, misinformation, malware, etc. These are some of the top concerns in the western part of the world in the sphere of security. Unfortunately, there is a significant deficit of inforamtion about threats and concerns in Eastern Europe. So, my task was analyzing young people's habits and experience online. The project is still being developed and soon the inforamtion about it will be updated with results of the research from major universities of Klaipeda. The data will further be used to create policy proposal for impoving current laws on cybersecurity.</p>
