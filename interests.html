			<h1>Reading</h1>
			<img alt="read" class="read" src="read.jpg" />
			<p>Reading is an important part of my life, as I spend a lot of my free time doing that. I am fond of old Russian and English literature of 19th century, as well as modern works. My favorite genres are dystopian and counter-cultural novels. I find reading facinating, as it allows you escaping the world that you now and entering another universe full of wonder, new experiences, and peculiar characters.</p>	
			<h1>Travelling</h1>
			<img alt="travel" class="travel" src="travel.jpg" />
			<p>I usually travel during my midterm breaks and on holidays. I enjoy visiting new countries, experiencing new cultures, getting know new people. Travelling often changes my perspective on things that always very stricty identified for me. New environment often alters my perception of the world and lets me get to know it better. I have plans to visit different continents and parts of the world. So far have travelled all around the Europe and visited United States of America, so I still have a lot ahead. The top place that I have visited by now is Alaska. I recommend it to everyone.</p>	
			<h1>Solving Puzzles</h1>
			<img alt="puzzle" class="puzzle" src="puzzle.jpg" />
			<p>Since childhood I was into solving puzzles. My all time favorite is "jigsaw puzzle". I started with 100 piecies and my biggest puzzle had 7000 pieces in it. Puzzles help me to relax and concentrate. Even though I am thinking about the puzzle,it often helps me to solve other problem that are on the back of my mind. Right know I am more into video puzzle games, like Hearthstone and Auto Chess. </p>
